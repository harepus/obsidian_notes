CIRT stands for Computer Incident Response Team. It is a group of individuals responsible for managing and responding to computer security incidents within an organization. The main goal of a CIRT is to minimize the impact of security incidents and restore normal operations as quickly as possible. The responsibilities of a CIRT may include:
	1. Monitoring and detecting potential security incidents.
	2. Investigating and analyzing security incidents to determine the cause and extent of the breach.
	3. Containing and mitigating the effects of a security incident to prevent further damage.
	4. Communicating with stakeholders, such as management, employees, customers, and law enforcement agencies, regarding the incident.
	5. Coordinating with other teams within the organization, such as IT, legal, public relations, etc., to ensure a comprehensive response.
	6. Developing and implementing incident response plans and processes to improve readiness for future incidents.
	7. Conducting post-incident analysis to identify lessons learned and make improvements to prevent similar incidents in the future.
	CIRTs often follow established frameworks or guidelines such as NIST's Computer Security Incident Handling Guide or ISO/IEC 27035:2016 Information technology - Security techniques - Information security incident management.
